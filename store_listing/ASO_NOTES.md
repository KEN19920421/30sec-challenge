# ASO (App Store Optimization) Notes

## Recommended Screenshot Descriptions

Design all screenshots as 1290x2796px (iPhone 15 Pro Max) for the App Store and 1080x1920px for Google Play. Use the app's actual UI with bold headline text overlaid at the top or bottom of each frame.

### Screenshot 1 -- "Today's Challenge"
**Headline:** "A New Challenge Every Day"
**What to show:** The challenge detail screen displaying today's active challenge with the countdown timer, challenge theme/title, difficulty badge, and the "Record Now" call-to-action button. Show an engaging challenge title (e.g., "Show Us Your Best Dance Move" / "あなたの一番のダンスを見せて"). Include the LIVE badge and entry count to convey active participation.

### Screenshot 2 -- "Record in 30 Seconds"
**Headline:** "30 Seconds. That's All You Need."
**What to show:** The recording screen with the circular timer ring showing about 18 seconds elapsed. Show the camera controls (flip, flash), the progress ring transitioning color, and a preview of someone mid-recording. This communicates the core mechanic immediately.

### Screenshot 3 -- "Swipe to Vote"
**Headline:** "Swipe. Vote. Decide."
**What to show:** The voting screen with a video card in the center and visible swipe gesture indicators. Show the vote buttons (thumbs up, Super Vote) at the bottom. Overlay a subtle swipe motion graphic. This highlights the fun, Tinder-like discovery experience.

### Screenshot 4 -- "Leaderboard"
**Headline:** "Climb the Ranks"
**What to show:** The leaderboard screen with the Top 3 podium widget prominently displayed, showing avatars with rank medals (gold/silver/bronze). Below, show the scrollable ranked list with scores. Include the tab bar showing Daily/Weekly/All-Time/Friends to communicate depth.

### Screenshot 5 -- "Gifts & Sparks"
**Headline:** "Support Creators You Love"
**What to show:** The gift catalog screen with animated gift items displayed in a grid. Show the Sparks balance badge in the corner. Include a gift animation overlay if possible. This communicates the virtual economy and social gifting feature.

### Screenshot 6 -- "Go Pro"
**Headline:** "Unlock Your Full Potential"
**What to show:** The Pro subscription screen showing the benefits list (no ads, Super Votes, Pro badge, 1.5x multiplier, early access). Show both monthly and annual pricing options with the "Save 33%" badge on the annual plan. Use a premium/elevated visual treatment.

### Japanese Screenshots
Use identical layouts with Japanese headline text and the app set to Japanese locale. Recommended headlines:
1. "毎日新しいチャレンジ"
2. "30秒。それだけでいい。"
3. "スワイプ。投票。決める。"
4. "ランキングを駆け上がれ"
5. "お気に入りのクリエイターを応援"
6. "あなたの可能性を最大限に"

## App Preview Video Suggestions

### Primary App Preview (15-30 seconds)
**Storyboard:**
1. (0-3s) Quick montage of diverse creators filming 30-second videos -- energetic music starts
2. (3-7s) Show the challenge screen with today's theme appearing, then tap "Record Now"
3. (7-12s) Recording screen with the timer ring filling up -- show the urgency of 30 seconds
4. (12-16s) Rapid swipe-voting montage -- cards flying left and right, Super Vote animation
5. (16-21s) Leaderboard screen -- camera zooms into the #1 position, confetti/celebration
6. (21-25s) Gift animation playing over a video, Sparks counter incrementing
7. (25-30s) App icon with tagline "Create. Compete. Win." and download CTA

**Music:** Upbeat, energetic, short-form content style (royalty-free)
**Tone:** Fast-paced, exciting, youthful
**Key message:** The thrill of the daily 30-second creative competition

### Secondary Preview (Social Features Focus)
Shorter 15-second cut focusing on the community aspect: following creators, voting on content, sending gifts, and the Friends leaderboard. Target users who respond more to social/community messaging than competition.

## Keyword Strategy Notes

### App Store (iOS) - 100 Character Limit
**Primary keyword set:** `video,challenge,daily,short,creative,competition,leaderboard,social,vote,30sec`

**Strategy:**
- "video" and "challenge" are the two highest-volume relevant terms -- always include
- "daily" differentiates from one-off challenge apps
- "30sec" is the branded term and captures "30 second" searches
- "short" captures users searching for short-form video content
- "leaderboard" and "competition" target gamification-oriented users
- "vote" is unique to this app's mechanic and has low competition
- Avoid wasting characters on "app", "free", or the app name (already indexed)

**Alternative keyword sets to A/B test:**
- Set B: `video,challenge,daily,creator,compete,ranking,social,gift,short,record`
- Set C: `video,challenge,30second,creative,contest,rank,community,vote,daily,film`

### Google Play (Indexed from Title + Description)
Google Play indexes keywords from the full description, so the strategy differs:

**Title optimization:** "30sec Challenge" -- short, memorable, includes primary keywords
**Short description:** Front-load with "Daily 30-second video challenges" to capture key terms

**Keyword density targets in Full Description (mention 3-5 times each):**
- "challenge" / "challenges"
- "video" / "videos"
- "30 seconds" / "30-second"
- "vote" / "voting"
- "leaderboard" / "ranking"
- "creators" / "community"
- "daily"

**Long-tail keywords to weave into description:**
- "daily video challenge app"
- "30 second video competition"
- "short video contest"
- "creative challenge community"
- "video voting app"
- "daily creative challenge"

### Japanese Keyword Strategy

**App Store (iOS):** `動画,チャレンジ,毎日,ショート,クリエイティブ,コンペ,ランキング,ソーシャル,投票,30秒`

**Key considerations for Japanese market:**
- Japanese users often search in a mix of katakana, hiragana, and kanji
- "チャレンジ" (challenge in katakana) is high-volume
- "動画" (video) is preferred over "ビデオ" in search
- "ランキング" (ranking) is more commonly searched than "リーダーボード" (leaderboard)
- "投票" (voting) captures both the voting mechanic and contest-style searches
- "30秒" captures the branded time constraint
- Consider including "TikTok" alternatives like "ショート動画" (short video) for discovery

### Competitor Keywords to Monitor
- TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts (short video space)
- ZEPETO, Rec Room (social/creative apps)
- Trivia/challenge apps (daily engagement mechanic)

### Seasonal / Trending Keyword Opportunities
- Update promotional text for holidays ("Holiday Challenge Season is Here!")
- Add seasonal keywords during peak periods (summer, New Year)
- Leverage trending challenge themes in the "What's New" section

### Localization Priority (Future)
1. Korean (large short-video market)
2. Portuguese (Brazil -- massive creator economy)
3. Spanish (broad reach across Latin America and Spain)
4. Thai (high social media engagement)

## Additional ASO Recommendations

### Ratings & Reviews Strategy
- Prompt for App Store rating after a user wins their first challenge or receives their first gift (high-emotion moment)
- Never prompt during recording, voting, or immediately after a failed upload
- Implement the SKStoreReviewController / In-App Review API with a 3-day minimum delay between prompts

### Category Selection
- **App Store Primary:** Social Networking
- **App Store Secondary:** Entertainment
- **Google Play Primary:** Social
- **Google Play Secondary:** Entertainment

### Update Frequency
- Aim for at least one update every 2-3 weeks to signal active development
- Use the "What's New" section to highlight new challenge categories, features, or seasonal events
- Update promotional text (App Store) weekly -- it does not require a new build

### Icon & Branding
- The app icon should convey "video + competition" at a glance
- Consider a play button merged with a trophy or timer element
- Test 2-3 icon variants using App Store product page optimization (iOS) or Google Play store listing experiments
